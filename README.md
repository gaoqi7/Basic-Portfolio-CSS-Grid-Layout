# Basic-Portfolio-CSS-Grid-Layout
Basic-Portfolio project build with CSS grid layout.
## I did the homework in two way. This is the second method.
#### Please check the my repository `gaoqi7/Basic-Portfolio` for method one. 
The Reason...   
  * New Toy. Just learn the CSS grid layout, I need pratice more.
  * Great tool. Save me a lot of time. Especially comparing with building layout with *float* and *positioning*.
  * **Be there And Be square**. Change the way I view the webpage.  

The Way...
  * Combine `grid` layout and `flexbox` for Header. In flexbox, I can style the elements seperately.
  * In webpage `portfolio.html`, I use `z-index` combine the layers listed below together.

        Layer 1 (Picture layer) : profolio-frame-z1

        Layer 2 (Banner layer)  : profolio-frame-z2

        Layer 3  (font layer)   : profolio-frame-z3
  * In webpage `contact.html`, in `form "Message"`, I didn't use `<input>`, but `<textarea>` for multiple input line.

The Next...
  * Sticky footer still not as perfect as in method one. Still can't always staying at bottom while browser size changing.
